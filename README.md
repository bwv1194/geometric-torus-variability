### Geometric-torus-variability

#### Author: Junyao Li, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign

This repository includes example codes used to generate geometric torus models, calculate the corresponding transfer functions, simulate mid-infrared light curves as the delayed and smoothed response to the driving optical light curves, and derive structure functions of the simulated light curves.
